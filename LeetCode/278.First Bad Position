Approach : Binary Search with some minor change

My Code :
#define ll long long
class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        ll l =1;
        ll r = n;
        ll ans = 0;
        
        while(l<=r){
            ll mid = floor((l+r)/2.0);
            if(isBadVersion(mid)){
                ans = mid;
                r = mid-1;
            }
            else{
                l = mid+1;
            }
            
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
